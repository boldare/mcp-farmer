## Code Style

- Write simple but robust and idiomatic TypeScript code
- Prefer early returns, simple control flow and imperative approach over complex abstractions and accidental complexity
- Only use comments if they add additional context not jut duplicate the code

## CLI Conventions

- Exit codes: 0 (success/pass), 1 (findings/fail), 2 (invalid usage/error)
- Errors to stderr, results to stdout
- Provide actionable error messages

## Error Handling

- Catch errors at boundaries and convert to user-friendly messages
- Use try/finally to ensure connections and resources are cleaned up
- Set timeouts on all network operations

## Project Organization

- Keep entry point thin, delegate to focused modules
- Modularize by low coupling and high cohesion
